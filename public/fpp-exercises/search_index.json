Use autoplot() to plot some of the series in these data sets. What is the time interval of each series? Use filter() to find what days corresponded to the peak closing price for each of the four stocks in gafa_stock. gafa_stock: Historical stock prices from 2014-2018 for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. PBS: Monthly Medicare Australia prescription data vic_elec: Half-hourly electricity demand for Victoria, Australia pelt: Hudson Bay Company trading records for Snowshoe Hare and Canadian Lynx furs from 1845 to 1935. Use autoplot() on pelt, both Hare and Lynx are showing some sort of cyclic patterns: pelt %&gt;% autoplot(Hare) pelt %&gt;% autoplot(Lynx) The four respective time interval are day (irregular but collected on a daily basis for the most part), month, 30 minutes and year. gafa_stock %&gt;% group_by(Symbol) %&gt;% filter(min_rank(desc(Close)) == 1) #&gt; # A tsibble: 4 x 8 [!] #&gt; # Key: Symbol [4] #&gt; # Groups: Symbol [4] #&gt; Symbol Date Open High Low Close Adj_Close Volume #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 AAPL 2018-10-03 230. 233. 230. 232. 230. 28654800 #&gt; 2 AMZN 2018-09-04 2026. 2050. 2013 2040. 2040. 5721100 #&gt; 3 FB 2018-07-25 216. 219. 214. 218. 218. 58954200 #&gt; 4 GOOG 2018-07-26 1251 1270. 1249. 1268. 1268. 2405600 Exercise 2.2 The aus_livestock data contains the monthly total number of pigs slaughtered in Victoria, Australia, from Jul 1972 to Dec 2018. Use filter() to extract pig slaughters in Victoria between 1990 and 1995. Use autoplot() and ACF for this data and compare these to white noise plots. aus_livestock &lt;- aus_livestock %&gt;% mutate(year = year(Month)) %&gt;% filter(year &gt;= 1990, year &lt;= 1995, Animal == &quot;Pigs&quot;, State == &quot;Victoria&quot;) aus_livestock #&gt; # A tsibble: 72 x 5 [1M] #&gt; # Key: Animal, State [1] #&gt; Month Animal State Count year #&gt; &lt;mth&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 1990 Jan Pigs Victoria 76000 1990 #&gt; 2 1990 Feb Pigs Victoria 78100 1990 #&gt; 3 1990 Mar Pigs Victoria 77600 1990 #&gt; 4 1990 Apr Pigs Victoria 84100 1990 #&gt; 5 1990 May Pigs Victoria 98000 1990 #&gt; 6 1990 Jun Pigs Victoria 89100 1990 #&gt; # ... with 66 more rows aus_livestock %&gt;% autoplot(Count) aus_livestock %&gt;% gg_season(Count) aus_livestock %&gt;% ACF(Count) %&gt;% autoplot() Based on current plots, it seems that pig slaughters in Victoria between 1990 and 1995 expericenced a general increase despite fluctuations. Lag plots have shown some sort of seasonality on a yearly basis. Pig slaughters tend to peak in one of the summer months, while remaining at a faily low level at both ends of a year. Exercise 2.3 The following time plots and ACF plots correspond to four different time series. Your task is to match each time plot in the first row with one of the ACF plots in the second row. 3 -&gt; D, 1 -&gt; B, both time series have a long-term trend (increasing and decreasing respectively), and the ACF plots should generally turn to be positive. And there is a clear seasonal effect in monthly air passengers so that its corresponding ACF plots should not be within the zero interval. 2 -&gt; A, 4 -&gt; C, time plot 2 has demonstrated seasonality within a year, while plot 4 seems to have some white noise.

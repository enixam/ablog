# Preface {-}  

This project is highly motivated and inspired by [stats337](https://github.com/hadley/stats337) at Stanford University offered by Hadley Wickham, and [Data Science with R: A Resource Compendium](https://bookdown.org/martin_monkman/DataScienceResources_book/) by Martin Monkman. They both provided great reading materials in data analysis with R, or applied data science in general. Here I attempt to finish one or two papers per week, draw a brief summary, and document my personal thoughts.

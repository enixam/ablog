<hr />
<p>More than 50 years ago, John Tukey in his renowned “The Future of Dat Analysis” envisioned a would-be field, where the subject of interest is to learn from data. Other pioneers, like John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently onece again exhorted academic statistics to embrace this so-called “data sicence / analysis” trend, to soar above theoretical statisticals which was characterized by theorems, proofs, etc. In this article, David Dohono presents a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are “learning from data,” and he describes an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner.</p>
<div id="data-science-vs.-statistics" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Data Science vs. Statistics</h3>
<p>The author first starts to distinguish data science from traditional statistics. Yet 3 commonly used indicators are discredited:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Big data” is not a credible criterion for meaningful distinction between statistics and data science, for both historical and scientific reasons, viz:</p>
<ul>
<li>The very term “statistics” was coined at the beginning of modern efforts to compile census data, roughly the size of today’s big data</li>
<li>Statisticians have long since delved into large databases, and come up with sufficient measures</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Although some would tout “new skills” on the part of data scientists, that is another “big data” meme cloaked in another term.</p></li>
<li><p>Data science programs doesn’t necessarily guide one to a satisfying job, comapared with statistics. Even it does, a data science master degree cannot exempt you from various constraints in real workplace</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, is there any solid case for establishing an new entity called “data science” ? David proposes that data science would be a true science, an enlargement of traditional academic statistics. And the underlying motivation is intellectual rather than commerical. In the next 50 years, scientific publicatiosn in various disciplines will become a body of data that we can analyze and study, and the opportunity to improve the accuracy and validity of all science relies upon this would-be field: data science.</p>
</div>
<div id="review-on-the-concept" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Review on the concept</h3>
<p>Based on the timeline, the author then organizes insights that have been published over the years about data science, as shown below:</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Tukey <label for="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-2" class="margin-toggle">1962<span class="marginnote">Tukey, John W. 1962. “The Future of Data Analysis.” <em>The Annals of Mathematical Statistics</em> 33 (1): 1–67.</span>)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All in all I have come to feel that my central interest is in data analysis, which I take to include, among other things: procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tukey identified four driving forces in the new science:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The formal theories of statistics</li>
<li>Accelerating developments in computers and display devices</li>
<li>The challenge, in many fields, of more and ever larger bodies of data</li>
<li>The emphasis on quantification in an ever wider variety of disciplines</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s spend a minute admiring Tukey’s prophecy…</p>
<p>Among other things, Tukey also pointed out that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…data analysis is a very difficult field. It must adapt itself to what people can and need to do with data. In the sense that biology is more complex than physics, and the behavioral sciences are more complex than either, it is likely that the general problems of data analysis are more complex than those of all three. It is too much to ask for close and effective guidance for data analysis from any highly formalized structure, either now or in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Data analysis can gain much from formal statistics, but only if the connection is kept adequately loose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="citation">(Chambers <label for="tufte-mn-3" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-3" class="margin-toggle">1993<span class="marginnote">Chambers, John M. 1993. “Greater or Lesser Statistics: A Choice for Future Research.” <em>Statistics and Computing</em> 3 (4): 182–84.</span>)</span></p>
<p>John Chambers presented a choice between “greater” or “lesser” statistics. He argued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The statistics profession faces a choice in its future research between continuing concentration on traditional topics—based largely on data analysis supported by mathematical statistics—and a broader viewpoint—based on an inclusive concept of learning from data. The latter course presents severe challenges as well as exciting opportunities. The former risks seeing statistics become increasingly marginal…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>C. F. Jeff Wu characterized statistical work as a trilogy of data collection, data modeling and analysis, and decision making, and called for courses outside out the statistics department.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Cleveland <label for="tufte-mn-4" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-4" class="margin-toggle">2001<span class="marginnote">Cleveland, William S. 2001. “Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics.” <em>International Statistical Review</em> 69 (1): 21–26.</span>)</span></p>
<p>William S. Cleveland put forward 6 foci of data science, which offered a great conceptual framework to study the filed even from today’s perspective :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Multidisciplinary investigations (25%)</p></li>
<li><p>Models and Methods for Data (20%)</p></li>
<li><p>Computing with Data (15%)</p></li>
<li><p>Pedagogy (15%)</p></li>
<li><p>Tool Evaluation (5%)</p></li>
<li><p>Theory (20%)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="citation">(Breiman and others <label for="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-5" class="margin-toggle">2001<span class="marginnote">Breiman, Leo, and others. 2001. “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures (with Comments and a Rejoinder by the Author).” <em>Statistical Science</em> 16 (3): 199–231.</span>)</span></p>
<p>UC Berkeley statistician Leo Breiman brought his “two modeling cultures theory” into the exhortation. He asserted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two goals in analyzing the data:<br />
Prediction: To be able to predict what the responses are going to be to future input variables;<br />
[Inference]: To [infer] how nature is associating the response variables to the input variables.<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">1</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">1</span> The original line was slightly modified by David, the original has “information” in place of [inference] and “extract some information about” in place of [infer]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proceeding from this basis, Brieman thought that the prdiction emphasis can be described as “predictive modeling” culture", which lay stress on accuracy of prediction made by different algorithm on various datasets. But this culture, according to his estimation, is only practiced by 2% of academic statisticians.</p>
<p>“Generative modeling culture” corresponds to the latter inference emphasis, and accounted for 98% statistical practices. Brienman said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on [generative] models</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From today’s standpoint, Breiman’s opinions is fairly justified by reality. But why? <span class="citation">(Donoho <label for="tufte-mn-6" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-6" class="margin-toggle">2017<span class="marginnote">Donoho, David. 2017. “50 Years of Data Science.” <em>Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics</em> 26 (4): 745–66. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734">https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734</a>.</span>)</span> thinks the Common Task Framework played a key role here.</p>
<p>An instance of the CTF has these ingredients( I actually have never heard the term before. To my mind, it’s just like a usual kaggle contest or a data visualization challenge, yet may not subjected ot choosing the “best” machine learning model or plot):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A publicly available training dataset involving, for each observation, a list of (possibly many) feature measurements, and a class label for that observation.</p></li>
<li><p>Set of enrolled competitors whose common task is to infer a class prediction rule from the training data.</p></li>
<li><p>A scoring referee, to which competitors can submit their prediction rule. The referee runs the prediction rule against a testing dataset, which is sequestered behind a Chinese wall. The referee objectively and automatically reports the score (prediction accuracy) achieved by the submitted rule.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The synergy of minimizing prediction error with CTF is worth noting. This combination leads directly to a total focus on optimization of empirical performance, allows large numbers of researchers to compete at any given common task challenge, and allows for efficient and unemotional judging of challenge winners.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> The Six Divisions</h3>
<p>Further, to dipict an even larger professional on a quest to extract information from data, the author comes up with a classificcation concerning data science practices:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Data Gathering, Preparation, and Exploration</strong></li>
<li><strong>Data Representation and Transformation:</strong> To tranfrom data collected from a wealth of formats in an attempt to represent them in one format susceptible for analysis.(i.e., get features with acoustic data, one often transforms to the cepstrum or the Fourier transform)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Computing with Data</strong>: Beyond basic knowledge of programming languages, data scientists need to keep current on new idioms for efficiently using those languages and need to understand the deeper issues associated with computational efficiency. Cluster and cloud computing and the ability to run massive numbers of jobs on such clusters has become an overwhelmingly powerful ingredient of the modern computational landscape.</li>
<li><strong>Data Modeling</strong></li>
<li><strong>Data Visualization and Presentation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Science about Data Science</strong>: Data scientists are doing science about data science when they identify commonly occurring analysis/processing workflows, for example, using data about their frequency of occurrence in some scholarly or business domain; when they measure the effectiveness of standard workflows in terms of the human time, the computing resource, the analysis validity, or other performance metric, and when they uncover emergent phenomena in data analysis, for example, new patterns arising in data analysis workflows, or disturbing artifacts in published analysis results.</li>

</div>
<div id="science-about-data-science" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> Science About Data Science</h3>
<p>David then elaborates on the 6th part: science about data science, which has made the realm a true branch of science, rather than a broad collection of technical activities. Data science offered a continually evolving, evidence-based approach for analysts, covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Science-Wide Meta Analysis: the idea of “analyzing what people have analyzed” across disciplines<br />
</li>
<li>Cross-Study Analysis: To study the validation of different studies on the same dataset. * Cross-Workflow Analysis: To study the impact of analysis workflow on results</li>
</ul>
<p>All these 3 approaches, comtribute to enhancing the validity of the scientific literature.</p>
</div>
<div id="next-50-years" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.5</span> Next 50 years</h3>
<p>At the end, what about the next 50 years of data science?</p>
<ul>
<li>Research will be more open and reproducible. Code sharing, data sharing will allow large numbers of datasets and analysis workflows to be derived from studies science-wide<br />
</li>
<li>All scientific publifications will be transformed to data thta can be mined<br />
</li>
<li>Ample data will be available to measure the performance of algorithms and models across a whole ensemble of situations</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.6</span> Conclusion</h3>
<p><label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span> For now, this section is copied from the original article</span></p>
<p>Each proposed notion of data science involves some <strong>enlargement</strong> of academic statistics and machine learning. The “GDS” variant specifically discussed in this article derives from insights about data analysis and modeling stretching back decades. In this variant, the core motivation for the expansion to data science is intellectual. In the future, there may be great industrial demand for the skills inculcated by GDS; however, the core questions which drive the field are scientific, not industrial.</p>
<p>GDS(initialtive for greater data science) proposes that data science is the science of learning from data; it studies the methods involved in the analysis and processing of data and proposes technology to improve methods in an evidence-based manner. The scope and impact of this science will expand enormously in coming decades as scientific data and data about science itself become ubiquitously available.</p>
<p>Society already spends tens of billions of dollars yearly on scientific research, and much of that research takes place at universities. GDS inherently works to understand and improve the validity of the conclusions produced by university research, and can play a key role in all campuses where data analysis and modeling are major activities.</p>

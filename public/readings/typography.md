Basic rules : 

- The typographic quality of your document is determined largely by how the **body text** looks. And the appearance of the body text is determined primarily by the following typographic choices:

  1. *Point size* is the how big the font is. In print, the most comfortable range for body text is **10–12 point**. On the web, **15–25 pixels**. Not every font appears equally large at a given point size, so be prepared to adjust as needed.  
  
  2. *Line spacing* is the vertical distance between lines. It should be **120–145%** of the point size. In word processors, use the “Exact” line-spacing option to achieve this. The default single-line option is too tight; the 150% line option is too loose. In CSS, use the `line-height` property (preferably with a unitless value, so 130% would become 1.3). 
  
  3. *Line length* is the horizontal width of the text block. Line length should be an average of 45–90 characters per line (use your word-count function) or 2–3 lowercase alphabets, like so ^[In a printed document, this usually means page margins larger than one inch (a typewriter habit). On a web page, it usually means preventing the text from flowing to the edges of the browser window.]:  




45 characters:    

> I think cynicism lasts. Sentimentality ages.



90 characters: (almost)

> Somewhat dramatic things happen, and you don't even always notice them — that's what life is.

  4. And most notably, *font choice*. Normally we could make a huge improvement ignoring system fonts and buy professional fonts. If that's not possible, make a wise choice of free fonts. And never use `New Roman` or `Arial`

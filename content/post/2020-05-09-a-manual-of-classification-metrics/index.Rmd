# Terminology


# Evaluating predicted classes

## Accuracy based criteria 

To make this more concrete. Suppose the event is having a disease, and sensitivity, specificity and prevalence are known. Then:  

$$
\text{sensitivity} = P(\text{true}|\text{disease}) \\
\text{specificity} = P(\text{true}|\text{no disease}) \\
\text{prevalence} = P(\text{disease})
$$

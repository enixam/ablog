This week I've had some recap on data wrangling in Python, specifically in `pandas` and `NumPy`. As an exercise, are available [here](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/)

```{python}
import pandas as pd

colors = pd.read_csv("D:/RProjects/data/blog/lego/colors.csv")
colors.head()
```


How many colors are available? 

```{python}
colors[['name']].info()
```

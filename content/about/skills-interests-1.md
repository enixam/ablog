I have developed great passion for data science and statistics in colledge, both in their rigourous beauty resided in mathematical thoery, and in applications devoted to real-world problems. Various literature in statistical machine learning, text mining, generalized linear models and recommender systems are current topics in which I spent most hours immerse myself. One of my treasured collectios are certificates of  received from relevant  courses

- [Statistical Learning](https://courses.edx.org/certificates/25fafd2ee0f6458eaa0da0e5eefdac26) from StanfordOnline and edX

- [Foundations of Big Data Analysis with SQL](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/KGR7GX67ZX5V) from Cloudera and Coursera

It's hard to tell why and when I fell in love with statistics and data science. Perhaps the vast branches of modern science with which it is inextricably interwoven dazzled me, or perhaps the cover of its textbooks are often well-desinged. Although I'm not a statistics major at college, I believe that there is a mission to solve real-world problems with statistical science. This conviction certainly became more explicit seeing talented researchers apply statistical methods to make active contributions during Covid-19. I also made poured in my own humble effort into the [Wuhan2020](https://github.com/wuhan2020/wuhan2020/blob/master/README_EN.md) project, which is a information collection platform for Covid-19 epidemic prevention.

I became an R user late in 2018. It all started from reading a a book called *Graphing with R: An introduction*, which teaches data visualizaiton mostly in base R. After that I read several more R books like *R in Action*. This zeal dramatically growed after [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) deeply impressed me with tidyverse's expressive syntax for data wrangling and visualzation.  Now, discovering a new R concept like a package or function is an exciting serendipity. You never know if youâ€™re about to learn something that fundamentally changes the way you code or solve data science problems. The discovering-learning-applying process is of indefinable joy that escaped the rest.  

The easiness of communication enpowered by the [rmarkdown](https://github/rstudio/rmarkdown) and the [bookdown](https://github/rstudio/bookdown) almost makes other programming languages necessary evil to me. That said, I have certain experience in Python's pandas and scikit-learn libraries. I spend fair amount of time on C and C++ to gain a better grasp of concepts in computer science. I also dabbled in web development to create data visualization applications for course projects.

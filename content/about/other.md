In my spare time, I enjoy watching natural documentaries and *Friends* repeatedly. I play basketball and video games (Overwatch for now). Other than technical things, I read books about cultural history, ecology, English writing, ancient Chinese poetry, and most importantly all works of Bertrand Russell.

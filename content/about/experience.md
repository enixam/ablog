   At a leading K-12 online English education company, I was involved in building an integrated teacher-evaluation system for free trials. With R and Python, I conducted extensive exploratory analysis and research on the influence of hardware setup, speaking speed, facial expressions and time management on conversion rate and customer review. I am involved throughout the project, ranging from problem definition, data cleaning, feature engineering, regression modeling, to the development of end-to-end web applications. 
   
   I am leading an ongoing project to optimize our adaptive placement testing system, based on item-response theory and deep knowledge tracing.

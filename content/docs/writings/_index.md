# Goals  

As a non-native Enlgish speaker, I have always found writing the most interesting, self-discovering and also challenging part throughout my self learning, during which acquaitance with new words and phrases, idioms and thesaurus becomes a pleasant serendipity. It also practical, to say that various English-centered tests and the need for clear illustration in data analysis projects have given me sufficient reasons to polish up my English writings skills. Anyway, this webpage is intened to be a collection of my miscellaneous writings, be they my random thoughts, excerpts from the transcripts of a documentary or a movie, readings notes of a insightful article, etc.

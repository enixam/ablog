I'm currently a junior majoring in data journalism at [Communication University of China](http://www.cuc.edu.cn/). I enjoy applied statistics as well as "modern" data science initiatives. I take particular interest in data wrangling, visualizing and modeling in `#rstats`.

I take equal delight in ancient Chinese literature, game theory, network analysis and sports statistics. My favourite author is Bertrand Russell. :black_nib:

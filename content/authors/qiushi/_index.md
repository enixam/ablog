Hello and welcome to my blog!

I am a graduate student at the Data Science Institute of Vanderbilt University. I enjoy working at the intersection of data science and web development to convert data insights into to products. For the data part I rely on R for everything and python for some model-heavy applications. For the frontend, I mostly use the react-typescript stack and occasionally svelte. I also have experience in developing backend APIs with python, node.js or elixir. 

In addition to tech staff, I love nature documentaries and cat videos. My favorite author is Bertrand Russell :black_nib:.

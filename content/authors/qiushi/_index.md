Hello and welcome to my blog!

I am a graduate student at the Data Science Institute of Vanderbilt University. I enjoy statistics and data science, particularly in data wrangling, visualizing and modeling in R and Python. 

I aspire to become a data scientist with strong engineering and development skills. I am keen on engineering data-driven applications with a combination of proven architecture and latest frontend technologies. I am also a fan of developing serverless applications on AWS and therefore get certified as a [AWS Developer Associate](/files/aws-cert-developer.pdf). Browse my [resume](/files/resume.pdf) and  [projects](#projects) to know more.  

In addition to tech staff, I love nature documentaries and cat videos. My favorite author is Bertrand Russell :black_nib:.
